// Each entry will be turned into an Apache RewriteRule as follows:
// RewriteRule ^<from>($|/) <to> [<rules>]
// <rules> defaults to: R=301,NC,L if you don't set it
// The ^<from>($|/) match means we'll grab a folder and all subfolders
// so order accordingly if you want /foo/bar to go somewhere other than
// where /foo goes
