Many companies have helped out LRUG and it's members in some way.  Here we list them and say thanks.  

Some of these companies even offer us discount codes for services or events.  For example, most of the publisher user group programs involve a discount code for their webstore.  Generally speaking we'll give out these codes when we find out about them during one of our [meetings](/meetings) or via the [mailing list](http://lists.lrug.org/listinfo.cgi/chat-lrug.org).

## Meeting Administration

### [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/)

Skills Matter have been the kind providers of the venue for LRUG since 2006.  As organisers of several conferences and training sessions they've also been kind enough to supply us with various discounts, and even free tickets, for these events on occasion.

## Meeting Sponsorship

From the [June 2009 meeting](/meetings/2009/05/19/june-20090-meeting) onwards, due to our [increasingly large membership](/members-and-friends/) we needed to get sponsors to help pay for the cost of renting a larger venue.
