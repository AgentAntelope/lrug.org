The January 2021 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 14th of April*,
from _6:20pm_ to _8:00pm_ (meeting starts at _6:30pm_).  Still online.

[Full registration details are given below](#april21registration), note
that **we will only be sending out the zoom meeting url to people who
have registered, so please do make sure you do it.**

## Agenda

We've got one talk lined up for you this month, but we always need more.
Email [talks@lrug.org](mailto:talks@lrug.org), if you'd like to start your
2021 presenting to the enthralled hordes of LRUG attendees.

### Git Rebase

[Brooke Kuhlmann](https://www.alchemists.io) says:

> Git is the dominant tool for version management. Misunderstanding and
> misusing Git can cost development teams time, energy, and money. Few
> better examples exist than Git's default merge workflow which creates
> repositories that are hard to read, debug, and maintain. In this
> talk, I'll show how to use the [Git Rebase
> Workflow](https://www.alchemists.io/articles/git_rebase) instead,
> which puts Git to work for you to produce quality code that's easy to
> handle and kicks your team into high gear.
>
> Your questions will be answered by [Brooke
> Kuhlmann](https://www.alchemists.io/team/brooke_kuhlmann) who is the
> founder of the [Alchemists](https://www.alchemists.io) where the
> mission is to create an inclusive and thoughtful collective focused
> on the craft, quality, ethics, and security of software engineering.

## Afterwards

We're all at home so there's no post-meeting pub meetup, however a few
attendees often hang around on in the zoom call after the talks are over.
It's a pale-shadow of the pub meetup, so if you have some ideas about
doing something better do get in touch at
[organisers@lrug.org](mailto:organisers@lrug.org).

## Registration {#april21registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
