The September 2023 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 11th of
September, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

## Agenda

### Your talk here!

Get in touch with us at talks@lrug.org if you'd like to speak. We're always happy to help new (or not so new) speakers.

## Afterwards

Once we're done with the talks we'll leave the venue (after doing our best
to help tidy up) and find a local pub to visit so we can eat, drink, and
discuss the talks we've just heard.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).
