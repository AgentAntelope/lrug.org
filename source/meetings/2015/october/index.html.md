Agenda
------

### Debugging and fixing performance issues with the mustache gem and partials

[Alice Bartlett](https://twitter.com/alicebartlett) and [Dom Baggott](https://twitter.com/evilstreak) say:

> A quick blast through encountering a feature with performance in the
> mustache gem. How we debugged it and how we fixed it. This talk will be
> a bit less boring than it sounds.

### API-first banking

[Jonas Huckestein](https://twitter.com/jonas) says:

> What would you build on top of your bank if it had a REST API & Webhooks? At Mondo, we're looking forward to finding out. Our API (plus Ruby client library) is in beta ([docs here](https://getmondo.co.uk/docs/)), and we hosted our first hackathon a couple of weeks ago. Come along to find out what people built!

### ActiveRecord vs N+1

[StanisÅ‚aw Klajn](http://stackoverflow.com/users/2336231/broisatse) says:

> In this talk would like to focus on dealing with N+1: how to detect it,
> how to get rid of it and, most importantly, how to avoid it.

Pub
---

Of the local pubs we've tried so far Singer Tavern seems the most accomodating so we'll try it again:

> Singer Tavern<br/>1 City Road<br/>EC1Y 1AG<br/><br/>[See on a map](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)

We aim to finish the talks no later than 8pm, which gives us an ETA of about 8:10 at the pub.  If you can't make the talks please do join us afterwards for food, drinks and ruby chat.

### Registration

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/7300-lrug-october-2015-meeting).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINASWAN)), so please do [register with Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/7300-lrug-october-2015-meeting).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2015/lrug-october/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell us you wish to attend.  It's just for the lols, innit?
