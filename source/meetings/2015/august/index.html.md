The August 2015 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 10th of August*, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm (talks start at 6:30pm).

### Venue change!

We're back with our usual hosts, [Skills Matter](http://www.skillsmatter.com), but it's in their new [Code Node venue](https://skillsmatter.com/locations/264-skills-matter-codenode) between Moorgate and Liverpool St. stations.  [Full venue and registration details are given below](#aug15registration).

Agenda
------

### Hello, declarative world

[Tom Stuart](http://codon.com) says:

> Ruby’s billed as a “multi-paradigm” language, but, let’s face it, we
> use it to write imperative object-oriented programs. I'm interested in
> different ways of programming computers, because I reckon imperative
> programs are far too low-level and overspecified, which is why as a
> species we're generally terrible at writing them. In this talk I want
> to encourage you to think outside of your normal programming habits;
> I’ll present a more abstract and declarative style called relational
> programming, and show you how to implement a minimal relational
> language in Ruby. (Dog whistle: this is [μkanren](http://webyrd.net/scheme-2013/papers/HemannMuKanren2013.pdf).)

### Domain Driven Design, In the Wild

[Chris Patuzzo](https://github.com/tuzz) says:

> Every day, we write software that solves business problems. How we
> actually do that is largely up to us. We tend to build models that
> encapsulate complexity and provide abstractions that help us reason
> about the problems we solve.
>
> We stress our models with incremental development. Changing business
> requirements challenge the durability of our models. The magnitude of
> change is an indicator for the effectiveness of our models' ability to
> represent the problem domain.
>
> At [Which?](https://github.com/whichdigital) we used [Domain Driven
> Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) to deliver
> our most recent project. In this talk, I will share those insights. I
> aim to cut through the jargon and give concrete, real-world examples of
> how we applied the principles of DDD to build a product that
> anticipates change.

### Ticket Giveaway

The organisers of [container.camp](http://container.camp), a conference about software virtualization to be held in London on 11th September, were kind enough to get in touch and provide a free ticket to their conference and a discount code for everyone.  The ticket was raffled off on our [mailing list](/mailing-list) with the winners contacted on Friday 7th August.  Thanks [container.camp](http://container.camp) organisers!

Pub
---

The talks will end at 8pm and we'll head to a local pub.  As it's a new venue we don't know which one yet.  Watch this space if you can't make the talks but want to join us afterwards.

The nice folk at [thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com), have agreed to put some money behind the bar at whichever pub we do end up at.  [Chad Pytel](https://twitter.com/cpytel) will be in attendance so do seek him out to thank him for buying your drink (and to find out what thoughtbot are up to in London).  Thanks [thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com) for supporting us!


Venue & Registration <a name="aug15registration">&nbsp;</a>
----------------------------------------------------------

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our [README](http://readme.lrug.org/).

### Venue

The venue for this meeting is:

> Skills Matter CodeNode<br/>10 South Place<br/>London<br/>EC2M 2RB<br/><br/>[See on a map](https://goo.gl/maps/ONJT4)

### Registration

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/7254-lrug-august-2015-meeting).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINASWAN)), so please do [register with Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/7254-lrug-august-2015-meeting).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2015/lrug-august/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell us you wish to attend.  It's just for the lols, innit?
