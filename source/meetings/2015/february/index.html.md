Agenda

### Lightning Talks!

As usual we give our February meeting over to lightning talks or no more than 10 minutes in length.

* Paul Battley: A library for handling postcodes
* Andrew Donovan: Finding and taking opportunities in the enterprise
* Paula Kennedy: Microaggression: Impact on Women in IT
* Mark Longair: Introducing [YourNextMP](https://yournextmp.com/)
* Evgeny Shadchnev: How to help beginners learn to code
* Alex Sunderland: The weird bits of ruby
* Pip Taylor: Sorting out [Colour](https://github.com/ms-digital-labs/color_sort)
* Michael Wawra: Tech Evangelism

All those talks are bound to generate some thoughts we'd like to discuss afterwards.  So we cross Goswell Road and head down to [The Slaughtered Lamb](http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/) to have those discussions in a more informal setting.  If you didn't make it for the talks then do feel free to turn up just for this bit.

Registration <a name="feb15registration">&nbsp;</a>
---------------------------------------------------

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/6984-lrug-lightening-talks-evening).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036)), so please do [register with Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/6984-lrug-lightening-talks-evening).  Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our [README](http://readme.lrug.org/).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2015/lrug-february/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attend.  It's just for the lols, innit?
