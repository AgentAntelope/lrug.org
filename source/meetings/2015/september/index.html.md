The September 2015 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 14th of September*, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm (talks start at 6:30pm).

### Venue change!

We're back with our usual hosts, [Skills Matter](http://www.skillsmatter.com), but it's in their new [Code Node venue](https://skillsmatter.com/locations/264-skills-matter-codenode) between Moorgate and Liverpool St. stations.  [Full venue and registration details are given below](#sep15registration).

Agenda
------

### How to onboard junior developers well

[Tatiana Soukiassian](https://twitter.com/binaryberry) says:

> A junior developer shares their experience and elements that have
> helped her learn and contribute better.

### Containers Patterns for Rails

[Jairo Diaz](https://twitter.com/codescrum) says:

> In this talk we explore how to use docker containers to run ruby on
> rails applications.  Rails applications usually require several
> different components such as Nginx, Redis, MySQL, Mongo and background
> jobs. We will show how to set up and manage the configuration of these
> elements.

### Debugging and fixing performance issues with the mustache gem and partials

[Alice Bartlett](https://twitter.com/alicebartlett) and [Dominic Baggott](https://twitter.com/evilstreak) say:

> A quick blast through encountering a feature with performance in the
> mustache gem. How we debugged it and how we fixed it. This talk will be
> a bit less boring than it sounds.

Pub
---

After the talks we continue the meeting at a nearby pub.  We're still trying out the local pubs to see which one will suit us the best.  This time we're going to try out Singer Tavern:

Our talks should end at about 8pm, so if you are unable to attend those you can still join us afterwards in the pub.

### Registration

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/7284).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINASWAN)), so please do [register with Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/7284).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2015/lrug-september/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell us you wish to attend.  It's just for the lols, innit?
