from _6:00pm_ to _8:00pm_ (meeting starts at _6:30pm_).  The venue, [Code
Node][skills-matter-venue] between Moorgate and Liverpool St. stations, is
provided by [Skills Matter](http://www.skillsmatter.com).  [Full venue and
registration details are given below](#nov19registration).

Agenda
------

### Call the Cops: Bringing style to a lawless codebase

[Scott Matthewman](https://twitter.com/scottm) says:

> Working with legacy codebases can be tricky at the best of times. What can
> make it worse if there’s no consistency in style. Linters (and Ruby’s RuboCop
> in particular) can help us write good code going forward – but what about the
> code that’s already there? There are good ways, and bad, to get RuboCop to
> help.

### Disk is fast, memory is slow. Forget all you think you know

[Daniel Magliola](https://twitter.com/dmagliola) says:

> Adding metrics to your code should effectively have no impact on performance.
> When we were recently tasked with doing that in multi-process Ruby servers, we
> ran into an interesting challenge: could we aggregate our numbers across
> processes without blowing our target of just one microsecond of overhead? In
> the process, we found some very counter-intuitive performance results that I'd
> like to share with you.

Afterwards
----------

We aim to wrap all the talks up by 8pm and then move the meeting into
socialising mode.  You have a choice for this:

1. [Code Node][skills-matter-venue].  Skills Matter run a bar with a
   choice of drinks (hard and soft) available.  As well as other LRUG members
   you can network with attendees of the other meetups that Skills Matter are
   hosting on the same night.
2. [The Singer Tavern](http://singertavern.com/).  This bar is a short walk
   north from Code Node (you can find it at [1 City Road, EC1Y
   1AG](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)).  This pub has a decent food menu on offer
   as well as a selection of drinks and other LRUG attendees to help you
   while the evening away.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

If you can't attend the talks we'd still be very happy to see you at this part
of the meeting.  Do come along!

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts

make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases
that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on
the same night.  Also, it's good manners, so please do [register with Skills
Matter][skills-matter-event].
