Agenda
------

### Simplify writing code with deliberate commits

[Joel Chippendale](https://twitter.com/joelchippindale):

> As developers, a key part of our work, is in breaking down large gnarly complex problems into smaller simpler ones. But this is hard and there are many distractions along the way. In this talk I will take you through 5 habits to adopt around commiting your code which will help you keep focussed on these smaller simpler problems and make it easier for you to write good code.


Afterwards
----------

All these talks will take us to around about 8pm, after which we have two
choices for socialising with your fellow LRUG attendees:

1. [Code Node][skills-matter-venue].  Skills Matter run a bar with a
   choice of drinks (hard and soft) available.  As well as other LRUG members
   you can network with attendees of the other meetups that Skills Matter are
   hosting on the same night.
2. [The Singer Tavern](http://singertavern.com/).  This bar is a short walk
   north from Code Node (you can find it at [1 City Road, EC1Y
   1AG](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)).  This pub has a decent food menu on offer
   as well as a selection of drinks and other LRUG attendees to help you
   while the evening away.

Regardless of what you choose to do, please remember that this part of the
meeting is still covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) even though it does seem more
informal.

If you can't attend the talks we'd still be very happy to see you at this part
of the meeting.  Do come along!

make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases

Matter][skills-matter-event].
