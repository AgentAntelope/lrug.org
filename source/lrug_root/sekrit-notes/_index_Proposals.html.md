Jon Gilbraith <jon@professionalnerd.com>
Over the last few months I've been refining a few techniques for managing views and have now ended up with a pretty nice way to abstract them away to the point that when creating new views I don't have to mess about with much html and css at all - it's all been buried away in nice ruby structures.  It makes creating new views a cinch and provides a great basis for fragment caching. Apr '09

Martin Kleppmann <martin@eptcomputing.com>
I've recently released a first version of a Ruby gem for managing invoicing, finances, accounts etc. within a commercial Ruby app -- see http://ept.github.com/invoicing/ -- and I would love to speak about it at some point if there is interest. I think the gem can be very useful to anybody developing a commercial or transactional web app -- it gets a lot of the boring stuff out of the way so that developers can focus on the important things." - Apr '09

"Any interest in a short (I promise :) talk about ruby FFI?" - May '09.

the talk will be on how to publish RDF from Rails, in particular
focusing on getting the Ruby/Rails community to participate in the
Linked Data (http://linkeddata.org). - Jun '09

Abdel A. Saleh <abdel.a.saleh@gmail.com>
'My DSL code review'.
Its based on pairing sessions with Sean O'Halpin and a talk I gave at work regarding a small Throttling library.  I go through the motions of why I thought a DSL was ideal to bring simplicity to some API calling chaotic code. And, how by continuously iterating and refactoring the code, using various DSLing techniques, it turns out that simple method calls were really the order of the day. - Jun '09

Tom Lea <>
drunit - Jun '09

Tom Stuart <tom@experthuman.com>
"a fun thing I did recently": I've written a fun little Ruby library, called VectorSpace, which makes it very easy to deal with operations on structured data (e.g. adding or multiplying multi-attribute values like "a price and the amount of tax and the available discount") by treating them as elements of a vector space. There are lots of niggly subtleties in getting this sort of thing right and the library abstracts away all of the mathematical hassle behind a tiny DSL. It's a bit nerdy, and there might be more to say about the fundamental idea of treating structs in this way than there is about the actual implementation, but still, it might be interesting or useful to someone. - Jul '09

Tomasz Wegrzanowski <tomasz.wegrzanowski@gmail.com>
Arduino is an inexpensive Open Source physical computing platform which makes building interactive gadgets of your design much easier on the hardware side. Now let's add some Ruby so programming those gadgets becomes easy too... Jul '09

Morten Bagai <morten@heroku.com>
"My presentation would be more of a general presentation of the platform, where we're going in the near future, what we'd like to know from you guys and of course some info on our plans for our European customers etc." - August '09

Taryn East <teast@globalpersonals.co.uk>
"Making your rails app kick ass with ruby-prof and kcachegrind"
I've used the above pair of apps a few times to profile some of the rails projects I've worked on. They're powerful tools that can let you dig down into the bowels of your code and find the real trouble-makers, but they require a bit of familiarity as they really are a bit of information-overload. So I thought I could give a talk on how to set them up - where/how to use them and what they can do for you. - August '09

Craig Webster - craig@xeriom.net
Something on the BBC deployment platform - Feb '09? - seems unlikely given he's not there anymore.

Jason Cale - jason.cale@mac.com
A quick talk on his viewports plugin (follow up to his CMS talk from Nov) - ??? '09?
He's not had as much time as he'd hope to work on this.  Is up for doing something at some point though (not necessarily on viewports).

Stephen Bartholomew - steve@curve21.com
Basically, my idea is stems from a talk that dhh gave about legacy software: http://railsconfeurope.blip.tv/file/1555560/.  I still work regularly on the first client rails app I developed back in 2006 and there's some really hanky parts of it.  I've started taking a different approach to working with it recently, slowly refactoring parts as I go.   The talk would be on the methods I've been using and various tips etc picked up along the way. Working title: "Learning to love the application you're with" - or a variation on that...  Jun / Jul '09?

Alex MacCaw <maccman@gmail.com> - bowline
idea is a preview of my GUI framework I've been working on - Feb '10
Needs to wait for Titanium (the underlying library) to get more stable.

Sam Aaron <samaaron@gmail.com>
"At the moment the kind of topics I'm currently interested in talking about are Communicative Programming, Ruby DSLs, Aesthetic Programming and fun stuff using Ruby to drive external hardware to make music. Completely non-Ruby topics could be an introduction to Ioke and yesterday I gave a super abstract summary of Alexander's "Notes on the Synthesis of Form" at Amsterdam.rb's BarCamp." - August 09 onwards?

Matt Wynne <matt@mattwynne.net>
I'd quite like to spread the word about my lazy Cucumber runner: http://github.com/mattwynne/cucover/tree/master - August (or October) '09

I have an idea for another talk: "Top 10 Horrendous Ruby Hacks". Including a vote on which is the worst and the honorary presentation of "Most Horrendous Ruby Hacker 2008".

August / September?
