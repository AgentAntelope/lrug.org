### Sekrits.  

## Ssssh!

The extra (hidden!) parts for this page contain notes about topics that people wanted to hear about, and proposals of talks that people want to give.  I tend to only add, rather than delete, so you'll have to work out what's been done and what hasn't for yourself.  They were originally stored in Stikkit, but that died, so excuse the odd formatting.
