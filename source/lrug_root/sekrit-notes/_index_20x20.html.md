Jairo Diaz - jairo.diaz@codescrum.com
I would like to suggest a lighting talk on an initiative to get more
qualified interns into Ruby. We suggest we call it "Tech interns".
The idea is to allow technical students who are planning to coming to
the Uk to learn Ruby and get in touch with London companies before
they arrive in the Uk.
In this way, instead of finding this people working in bar and
restaurants they can contribute their work to the community.

Richard Livsey - richard@livsey.org (in reserve in favour of more ruby-ish talks)
Something about MongoDB (Examples will be in Ruby/Rails using MongoMapper & I'll be doing it in 20x20 for the Mongo group too so the format's not a problem.)

Jakub Šťastný - stastny@101ideas.cz
At VMware/RabbitMQ we work on a project called SockJS which is, to cut
long story short, a WebSocket emulation library. You're probably
familiar with socket.io which does just that. However SockJS is
language-agnostic, much simpler, without unnecessary dependencies,
using WS(-like) API ... The Ruby client is Rack compatible, although
it works only with Thin (as support for asynchronous response is
required). So if you guys are interested, I'd be happy to talk about
it.

Tom Blomfield - tom@gocardless.com - (actually Harry to give talk - harry@gocardless.com) 
We've had a chat about what we might be able to speak about - we've built some custom documentation generators in ruby (https://gocardless.com/docs) with some interesting features like multi-language (ruby, php, curl etc) support, docs customised to your account and live response/request code samples that lead to a (sort-of) self-documenting API.

Stuart Eccles - stuart@madebymany.co.uk
Something about conan the deployer
