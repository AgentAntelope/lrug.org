Episode 8 of LRUG Nights will take place at the ["The Princess Louise "](http://www.fancyapint.com/pubs/pub482.html) on Thursday June 26th.

Come along for the usual mix of chat, beer and dead (or [not so dead](http://www.tv.com/baywatch-nights/balancing-act/episode/41748/summary.html)) bodies. Mitch will be undercover, but will certainly be there.
