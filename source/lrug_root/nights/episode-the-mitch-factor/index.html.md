So rumour has it that Mitch Buchannon is still on the run but due to technical 
difficulties he is stuck in a pub located somewhere in London.
 
We've used the latest tracking technology and reckon the [Mitre](http://tinyurl.com/38wwsjc) is
where he will be hiding. Sources suggest that he will be in 
the premises on Tuesday (tonight) 24th August from 6.30pm. 
Hopefully see you there!
