The next episode is about to begin, to take place at the ["Glasshouse Stores"](http://fancyapint.com/pubs/pub231.html) on March 2th.

Come along for the usual mix of chat, beer and hostage negotiation. Mitch will be undercover, and may (or may not) be [wearing a chicken costume](http://www.tv.com/baywatch-nights/pressure-cooker/episode/41747/summary.html?tag=ep_list;title;6).
