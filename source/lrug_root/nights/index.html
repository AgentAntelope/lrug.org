    <div id="about" class="content">
<p><strong>Sometimes it's nice to forget about learning.</strong> Sometimes it's nice to meet folk without having a predefined agenda.  Sometimes it's nice to drink beers. Sometimes it's nice to solve crimes in the seedy LA underworld. <em>But most of the time it's just nice to drink beers.</em></p>
	  <p>Welcome to <a href="/">LRUG</a> Nights.</p>
	  <p>A monthly meetup, roughly halfway between our <a href="/meetings/">regular meetings</a>, where we chat, drink beers, maybe solve crimes.</p>
