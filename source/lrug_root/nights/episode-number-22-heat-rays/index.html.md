[Tim Cowlishaw](http://twitter.com/mistertim/) wants to pretend he's at the [Scottish Ruby Conference](http://scottishrubyconference.com/) by drinking whisky in a pub in London and chatting about Ruby.  It'll be just like being there:

* Where: [Lord Wargrave](http://www.youngs.co.uk/pub-detail.asp?PubID=347) (it's got all the whisky) [map](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Lord+Wargrave+W1H+5HE&hl=en&hq=Lord+Wargrave+W1H+5HE&radius=15000&t=h&z=16&iwloc=A)
* When: Thursday 28th June, 2012
* Time: 6.30pm

Let us know if you might be coming via [the Lanyrd event](http://lanyrd.com/2012/lrug-nights-june/).
