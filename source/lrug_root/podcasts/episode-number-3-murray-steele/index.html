In this episode I'm joined by Murray Steele. Murray is a Ruby developer for Unboxed Consulting, organises our very own LRUG meetings and is one of the kingpins behind the successful Ruby Manor conference. Murray joined me a few days after his <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/ajax-ria/my-first-ruby">June LRUG talk</a> to chat about the first Ruby code he ever wrote. We also discussed what it takes to run a successful tech user group, and the advantages of community-run conferences compared to big, corporate ones.
